# Installing Node

There's more than one way to install Node, but we think the following instructions provide the best user experience.

## MacOS

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew: http://brew.sh/
Install Homebrew, then run the following command in a Terminal:

  brew install node

## Windows 10

We recommend installing Node using Chocolatey, a popular package manager for Windows: https://chocolatey.org/

Install Chocolatey, then open a Command Prompt as Administrator and run the following command:

  choco install nodejs.install

## Linux

Follow the installation instructions for your Linux distribution to install Node 6 or newer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
